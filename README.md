# my_levelup_story

My Levelup Story is an app that keeps track of your daily growth.

We are working on it using Flutter + Firebase.
It's currently under development.

## Library we used

* Riverpod
* Flutter Hooks
* State Notifier
* Freezed.

### DB

Firestore.

## Some of the things you'll learn include

It is written using Riverpod and Flutter Hooks.
The ViewModel uses a StateNotifier.
Riverpod and Flutter Hooks have only been around for a short period of time, so there is not a lot of information available on the internet.
So My Levelup Story is a valuable resource for learning about Riverpod and Hooks.

The repository code is a great way to get a better understanding of modern Flutter app development with Riverpod.
Some of the things you'll learn include.

* How to do MVVM and DI with Riverpod, Hooks and StateNotifier
* How to use Hooks (useProvider, useMemorize, useFuture)
* Immutable state using freezed
* How to use Firestore

Thank you for reading.
